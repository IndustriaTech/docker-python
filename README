MagicSolutions's Docker Python images
-------------------------------------

Here we store Dockerfile configurations for python images that we use with docker.
They are currently only two: one for Python2.7 and one for Python3.4.
Both are based on current debian stable (as of now Debian 8.2)

The images include:

 - Python with development header files
 - pip
 - Python drivers for accesing PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.
 - PIL (Pillow)

Everything is from standart Debian packages except MySQL client for Python3. It is installed with pip.
