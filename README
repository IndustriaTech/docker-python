MagicSolutions's Docker Python images
-------------------------------------

Here we store Dockerfile configurations for python images that we use with docker.
They are currently only two: one for Python2.7 and one for Python3.4.
Both are based on current debian stable (as of now Debian 8.2)

The images include Python with development header files and python drivers for accesing PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.
